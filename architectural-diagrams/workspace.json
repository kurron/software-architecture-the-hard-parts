In particular, the use of arrows and lines are often ambiguous and/or misleading, decreasing the understandability of the diagram.\n\n## Decision\n[Mark Richards](https://developertoarchitect.com/lessons/) has a simple set of conventions when it comes to lines and arrows that we will incorporate into our C4 views: [Lesson 94 - Guidelines for Architecture Diagrams](https://developertoarchitect.com/lessons/lesson94.html) and [Lesson 95 - Guidelines for Architecture Diagrams Revisited](https://developertoarchitect.com/lessons/lesson95.html).\n\n## Consequences\nBy taking using a simple convention when it comes to line and arrow use, people should more quickly understand what is being diagrammed with less ambiguity.",

      "content" : "# 1. Use Explicit Contexts\n\n## Status\nAccepted\n\n## Context\nMichael Nygard has a very interesting idea that should allow system to evolve over time. From his book [Release It!]():\n\n>Suppose your service receives this fragment of JSON inside a request: `{\"item\": \"029292934\"}`\n>\n>How much do we know about the item? Is that string the item itself? Or is it an item identifier? Maybe the field would be better named “itemID.” Supposing that it is an identifier, our service can’t do very much with it. In fact, only four things are possible:\n>\n>1. Pass it through as a token to other services. (This includes returning it to the same caller in the future.)\n>2. Look it up by calling another service.\n>3. Look it up in our own database.\n>4. Discard it.\n>\n>In the first case, we’re just using the “itemID” as a token. We don’t care about the internal structure. In this case it would be a mistake to convert it from string to numeric. We’d be imposing a restriction that doesn’t add any value and will probably need to be changed—with huge disruption—in the future.\n>\n>In the second and third cases, we’re using the “itemID” as something we can resolve to get more information. But there’s a serious problem here. The bare string shown earlier doesn’t tell us who has the authoritative information. If the answer isn’t in our own database, we need to call another service. Which service?\n>\n>This issue is so pervasive that it does not even look like a problem at first. In order to get item information, your service must already know who to call! That’s an implicit dependency.\n>\n>That implicit dependency limits you to working with just the one service provider. If you need to support items from two different “universes,” it’s going to be very disruptive.\n>\n>Suppose instead the initial fragment of JSON looked like this: `{\"itemID\": \"https://example.com/policies/029292934\"}`\n>\n>This URL still works if we just want to use it as an opaque token to pass forward. From one perspective, it’s still just a Unicode string.\n>\n>This URL also still works if we need to resolve it to get more information. But now our service does not have to bake in knowledge of the solitary authority. We can support more than one of them.\n>\n>By the way, using a full URL also makes integration testing easier. We no longer need “test” versions of the other services. We can supply our own test harnesses and use URLs to those instead of the production authorities.\n>\n>This example is all in the context of interservice communication. But making implicit context into explicit context has big benefits inside services as well. If you’ve worked on a Ruby on Rails system, you might have run into difficulty when trying to use multiple relational databases from a single service. That’s because ActiveRecord uses an implicit database connection. This is convenient when there’s just one database, but it becomes a hindrance when you need more than one.\n>\n>Global state is the most insidious form of implicit context. That include configuration parameters. These will slow you down when you need to go from “one” to “more than one” of a collaboration.\n\n## Decision\nWhen possible, we will use a URI as the primary key for objects. Depending on the system in question, it may not be an easily resolvable location and may have to be deconstructed a bit before getting to something readable. For example: `mongodb:read-only-user@mongodb.example.com:5762/some-dataset?_id=9876` probably won't have an available protocol handler, so one must be written.  \n\n## Consequences\nIf we can use stable names for the authority portion of the URI, we should be able to move services around and still have systems find the data they need. One element we have to be keenly aware of is that changing the scheme portion later will be very difficult, if not impossible. If available, an HTTP or GraphQL URI should be preferred over direct database or coordinates. In practical terms, this means that we still use database generated primary keys but return a URL as the ID of the asset.  For example, document `1234` would be exposed to the caller as `http://alpha.test.example.com/user/1234`. If that URI is ever \"tugged\" on, hyperlinks are provided to other possible operations on the resource.",

Over time, those routing rules will change and we want a mechanism that allows for easy evolution of the system.\n\n## Decision\nLeverage the [Message Router](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageRouter.html) pattern both at the external (AMQP) and internal (Spring Integration) messaging levels. In particular, messages should provide a `label` field that can be used to make routing decisions based on pattern matching.\n\n## Consequences\nAltering what component handles a particular class of message should be a trivial configuration change, requiring only small code changes.  For example, one day the label `command.character.new` could be routed to a component that handles all character commands but on the next day, that same label could be routed to a component dedicated to handling that command only.  Such flexibility should reduce the maintenance cost of the system. AMQP specifies the `Topic Exchange` and Spring Integration the `HeaderValueRouter` for just this purpose.",

The key notion is that the response payload contains links to allowable operations, guiding the UI through the workflow.  Although we currently do not have plans to drive the UI, we do support the notion of an explicit context for all of our identifiers. Hypermedia and the HAL format supports that.\n\n## Decision\nLeverage the [Spring HATEOAS](https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas) framework to manage the hyperlinks provided in API responses. The framework simplifies the management of links, including understanding location of the application sitting behind an API Gateway or proxy.  Being a Spring project, it understands the programming model used, greatly reducing the amount of configuration and code required to support hypermedia.\n\n## Consequences\nBy taking advantage of an exiting framework, we can use the linking concepts in the HAL format to ensure we're always using identifiers in an explicit context. In theory, the UI could be modified to take advantage of hypermedia to drive the workflow of operations. Using HAL, however, might prove to be a complication if we decide to introduce GraphQL. It is unclear how HAL can be generated when combining results from different services. ",

      "content" : "== Context\nGURPS Online is a new system, providing an online version of the traditional, paper based http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/resources/CampaignPlanning.pdf[campaign] and http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/resources/CharacterSheet.pdf[character] sheets. GURPS Online is intended to ease the creation of worlds, campaigns and characters, not run them.  Games will continue to be played by friends sitting around the kitchen table using the generated assets. GURPS Online is a departure from existing products the company sells so there is no integration with existing systems. It stands alone.\n\nThroughout the document, we reference a few people that help to describe the types of users of the system. First, we have Gary who is the Game Master interested in creating worlds and campaigns for his friends. Next, we have Penny who is a Player interested in creating characters compatible with Gary's campaigns. Finally, we have Adam who administrates the system, typically installing new assets and managing users.  The system is web based but does allow viewing of assets on mobile devices. Editing on mobile, however, is not supported.\n\nGary has the responsibility of creating an entire world from his imagination as well as creating a story for characters to experience in that world. He is tasked with making several decisions, including:\n\n* the genre of the campaign, e.g. science fiction\n* the campaign style, e.g. realistic, cinematic\n* planes of existence\n* society type\n* technology level\n\nPenny has to make choices when creating her character, including:\n\n* race\n* skills\n* advantages\n* attribute point allocation\n\nAdam, using his bulk operation tool, is adding new assets to the system, including:\n\n* armor\n* weapons\n* skills\n* advantages\n\nWARNING: figure out how to embed the context diagram",

Is it clear which features, functions, use cases, user stories, etc are significant to the architecture and why?\n. Is it clear who the important users are (roles, actors, personas, etc) and how the system caters for their needs?\n. Is it clear that the above has been used to shape and define the architecture?\n. Is it clear what the system does from a process perspective?\n. What are the major processes and flows of information through the system?\n. Feel free to reference existing documentation\n. The goal is to provide an *overview*\n. Sequence diagram when discussing automated business processes is useful\n. Technical and non-technical people, both inside and outside the immediate development team\n\nThe goal of the system is make it easier for people who want to play GURPS to find worlds and campaigns of interest to them. To that end, everything in the system is searchable and has infinite lifetime. Players won't have to worry about a campaign disappearing on them because the author decided to delete one of his published worlds.\n\n=== Worlds and Campaigns\nGary decides one day that he wants to create a world and a campaign within that world. Using GURPS Online, he'll be guided through a series of screens that helps with that process, including the selection of technology levels, government structures and geography.  He'll have access to a catalog of weapons, spells, armor and technologies to include in his campaign. These catalogs include content created by other game masters. Gary has the option to publish his works to the community for others to use, if he desires.\n\n=== Characters\nPenny uses the system to search for campaigns that sound interesting to her. She likes to search by genre, such as horror, but also keeps tabs on her favorite campaign creators, getting text and e-mail notification when new works are published. She also uses the system to see if a new group has formed to play any of the campaigns she is watching. Once she has joined a group, she creates a new character based on the world and campaign constraints.  GURPS Online will advise her if any of her existing characters are playable in the campaign, saving her the time to create one. When joining a new game, Penny will familiarize herself with the world by download the PDFs of relevant assets. She doesn't get access to the game master's notes of course, as that would spoil the fun. Only he can see his notes.\n\n=== Message Board\nWhile GURPS Online does not run games, we do provide a very basic message board where the community can find when a new game is starting up. We are not in the business of managing online abuse, the boards are very limited, only providing just enough information for players to decide if they want to reach out to game master for more details.\n\n=== System Housekeeping\nAdam is tasked with administering the system, including importing new assets, dealing with conduct violations and removing assets violating community policies. Adam sometimes has to go in and remove postings that violate the terms of service.\n\n=== Obtaining Assets\nGURPS Online uses https://ipfs.tech/[IPFS] to distribute assets, avoiding any content filtering that some governments do. We realize that we're only facilitating playing a game but we feel strongly enough that everyone should have access to fun that we're willing to use a relatively new technology to get the assets into the hands of players, regardless of politics.\n\n",

This keeps the initial development costs down while providing a path in the future for growth.  Our developers are skilled JVM programmers but we don't have the time or budget to create any bespoke frameworks for this solution. For that reason, the system is built using frameworks plucked from the Spring ecosystem. Further, we're using Kotlin running on contemporary JVM releases, giving us further productivity gains.\n",

Instead, we use a packaging concept described in https://youtu.be/5OjqD-ow8GE[Modular Monoliths] and https://youtu.be/48C-RsEu0BQ[Creating a Loosely Coupled Monolith]. The main idea is that each capability of the system is partitioned into its own \"slice\" of the code base. We've taken the approach of using Maven modules as the primary partitioning construct. Unfortunately, Kotlin's `internal` does not work in multi-module Maven projects, so we cannot depend on the compiler in preventing cross-feature coupling. At the persistence layer, we use the same physical database host but give each module its own namespace, preventing modules from directly accessing each other's data. Lastly, we use messaging when interacting with modules, decoupling them in space and time. Only the message broker needs to be available for the system to function.",
