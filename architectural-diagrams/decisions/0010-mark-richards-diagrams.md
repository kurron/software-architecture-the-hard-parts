# 1. Use Mark Richards' "arrow" Notation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Looking at a static diagram, especially when printed on a black and white printer, it can be difficult to quickly grasp how each component interacts with others. In particular, the use of arrows and lines are often ambiguous and/or misleading, decreasing the understandability of the diagram.

## Decision
[Mark Richards](https://developertoarchitect.com/lessons/) has a simple set of conventions when it comes to lines and arrows that we will incorporate into our C4 views: [Lesson 94 - Guidelines for Architecture Diagrams](https://developertoarchitect.com/lessons/lesson94.html) and [Lesson 95 - Guidelines for Architecture Diagrams Revisited](https://developertoarchitect.com/lessons/lesson95.html).

## Consequences
By taking using a simple convention when it comes to line and arrow use, people should more quickly understand what is being diagrammed with less ambiguity.
